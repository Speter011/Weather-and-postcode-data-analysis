## Weather and postcode analysis

This project analyses postcode and weather data using a Map GUI in java to output the results. The GUI is built on the https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JMapViewer open-source 

#### Postcodes
The data is given in `.csv` files in the `data` folder. `postcodes.csv` contains 1.6 million UK postcodes with their coordinates included. `fy.csv` is the subset of postcodes in Blackpool, starting with FY.

#### Weather data
Weather recordings from 2015 are located in the `WeatherData.jar` file.
